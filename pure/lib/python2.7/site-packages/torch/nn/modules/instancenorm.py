    .. math::

    The mean and standard-deviation are calculated per-dimension separately
    for each object in a mini-batch. :math:`\gamma` and :math:`\beta` are learnable parameter vectors
    of size `C` (where `C` is the input size) if :attr:`affine` is ``True``.

    By default, this layer uses instance statistics computed from input data in
    both training and evaluation modes.

    If :attr:`track_running_stats` is set to ``True``, during training this
    layer keeps running estimates of its computed mean and variance, which are
    then used for normalization during evaluation. The running estimates are
    kept with a default :attr:`momentum` of 0.1.

    .. note::
        This :attr:`momentum` argument is different from one used in optimizer
        classes and the conventional notion of momentum. Mathematically, the
        update rule for running statistics here is
        :math:`\hat{x}_\text{new} = (1 - \text{momentum}) \times \hat{x} + \text{momemtum} \times x_t`,
        where :math:`\hat{x}` is the estimated statistic and :math:`x_t` is the
        new observed value.

    Args:
        num_features: :math:`C` from an expected input of size
            :math:`(N, C, L)` or :math:`L` from input of size :math:`(N, L)`
        eps: a value added to the denominator for numerical stability. Default: 1e-5

            statistics in both training and eval modes. Default: ``False``
